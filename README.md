This automated voting system for institutions and/or organizations is implemented using the Django-built Voting System web application. The voting process is similar to the conventional election manual system in that the list of candidates and voters must be entered into the system. This e-voting system was made for a capstone project by a student. The user interface of the system has two parts: one for administrators and one for voters. The administrator is in charge of populating and managing the data of the system and the voter side, which is where the voters will choose their candidate and submit their votes.

## How the system works
Administrator is required to create candidates and set schedule. 
After doing this, the voters can vote based on his/her department

## How do voters get verified ?
OTP is sent to voter's email.
The OTP is sent via an python SMTP gateway. 

## Can OTP verification be bypassed ?
Yeah, sure.
Open `settings.py` and toggle `OTP` to  `False`
Then, wait till server restarts

## If OTP is True
Fill up the OTP_EMAIL and OTP_PASSWORD in settings.py
then go to your gmail settings and allow less secure apps for smtp to enable
